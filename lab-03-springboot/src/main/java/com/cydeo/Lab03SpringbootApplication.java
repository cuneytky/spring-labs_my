Generating data
You will directly call ShareService on recipeService from Main. You need to
create 100 recipe using for loop.
While recipe object creation you will need some data. In this point you are going to use
JavaFaker library. As a result you need to inject the faker class to recipeService.
As you can see on screenshots, every time you call the fakerâ€™s methods it will return
different results and also Faker has many options that you can create fake data with
different types

Some of options provided by Faker
